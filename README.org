* Small programs for practicing haskell
** Connected4 game
- The idea is to iteratively and incrementally develop connected4 game which can be played as human vs human  or human vs computer.
- There are solutions available that can ensure computer's victory.
- Instead of using such solution, this project will use heuristic based approach(vs knowledge base approach) for the computer player.
- Well, because solutions that ensure victory may not provide much advantage(could be a wrong assumption) in designing code to allow changing board representation, heuristic function etc. Even such design can make the computer player slow! Also implementing such solution may require lot of work in optimization which will defeat the goal of learning haskell so :)
- Current tentative milestones[3/9]:
  - [X] Implement a simple human vs human text based game.
  - [X] Restructure code to allow changing board representation.
  - [X] Implement a Binary Board representation.
  - [ ] Restructure code to allow changing player and player can be human or computer.
  - [ ] Implement a simple computer player.
  - [ ] Implement a good enough computer player.
  - [ ] Restructure code to easily allow changing the front end.
  - [ ] Implement a better text-based version for display.
  - [ ] Implement a graphics based version.

** Bytecode Evaluator
*** Problem Statement:
You are a TA at a university, and you want to evaluate your studentâ€™s homework
without executing their (untrusted) code. You decide to write a small
web-service that takes bytecode as input, and interprets the results.

The bytecode language you need to support includes basic arithmetic and
variables. The bytecode language is stack, rather than register based.
ByteCode (right) is given for the following pseudo code (left):

|--------------------+-------------------|
| *Pseudo Code*      | *ByteCode*        |
|--------------------+-------------------|
| function f() {     |                   |
| x = 1              | LOAD_VAL 1        |
|                    | WRITE_VAR â€˜xâ€™ |
| y = 2              | LOAD_VAL 2        |
|                    | WRITE_VAR â€˜yâ€™ |
| return (x + 1) * y | READ_VAR â€˜xâ€™  |
|                    | LOAD_VAL 1        |
|                    | ADD               |
|                    | READ_VAR â€˜yâ€™  |
|                    | MULTIPLY          |
|                    | RETURN_VALUE      |
| }                  |                   |
|--------------------+-------------------|

Add a data type `ByteCode` that can represent bytecode like in the example
above, along with an interpreter for said bytecode. Make sure your code is
total.
*** It is a cabal project and to run it for the given example use the following:

  #+begin_src bash
  >cd haskell-minis
  >cabal build bytecode
  >cat input/bytecode-example-input.txt | cabal run bytecode 
  #+end_src

*** Examples in repl
  #+begin_src bash
  >cd haskell-minis
  >cabal repl bytecode
